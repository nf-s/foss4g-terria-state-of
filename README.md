## Description

TerriaJS is an open-source framework for web-based geospatial catalogue explorers.

It uses Cesium and Leaflet to visualise 2D and 3D geospatial data, and it supports over 50 different Web APIs, file formats and open data portals.

It is almost entirely JavaScript in the browser, meaning it can even be deployed as a static website, making it simple and cheap to host.

TerriaJS is used across the globe to create next-generation Digital Twin Platforms for open geospatial data discovery, visualisation and sharing - it is used to drive

- [National Map](https://nationalmap.gov.au/) (Australian Gov)
- [Digital Earth Australia Map](https://maps.dea.ga.gov.au/)
- [Digital Earth Africa Map](https://maps.digitalearth.africa/)
- [Pacific Map](https://map.pacificdata.org/)
- [Vic Spatial Digital Twin](https://vic.digitaltwin.terria.io/) (Australian State Gov)
- and many others

In this talk, I will give:

- Background information about TerriaJS and how it is used by the community
- Current state of the project for users, developers and wider community
- New features
- Future plans!
